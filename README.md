# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
I have been hired as a data analyst for PyBer, a Python based ride share company. My first task was to prepare a presentation for the CEO, V. Isualize. I have now been asked to utilize my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride share data by each city type. My next task was to create a multi-line graph visualizing the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib.
## Results
* Urban cities have the most ride count (1625) and most drivers (2405)
** Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride ($24.53) with the average fare per driver being $16.57
* Rural cities have the least ride count (125) and least amount of drivers (78)
** Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) with the average fare per driver being $55.48

## Summary
The data clearly shows that demand varies according to the city type. Urban cities have a higher demand for rides, resulting in more drivers. With there being a larger ride count, ride fares are lower in urban cities due to the demand. Rural cities have the least ride count, showing that the demand for a ride is less. Rural cities have the least amount of drivers but the ride fare is the highest. Suburban cities come in at the middle showing that the demand is neither high nor low.
### Recommendations:
* Drivers should charge a surcharge during peak hours in the urban areas as well as charging more per mile. Peak hours are usually during rush hour which can result in sitting in traffic, or longer driving times. Charging a surcharge and having a higher charge per mile can help drivers earn more per fare.
